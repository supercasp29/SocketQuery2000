# Socket Server 🔌

## Overview

This project is a simple socket server that listens for client connections and processes basic commands. It is containerized using Docker 🐳 for easy deployment.

## Features ✨

- Accepts multiple client connections using threads (each client runs in a separate thread for efficient handling)
- Handles the following commands:
  - `WHO` - Returns the number of connected clients
  - `WHERE` - Returns a unique server identifier (UUID)
  - `WHY` - Returns "42" as an answer
  - Unrecognized commands return an error message ❌
- Graceful shutdown on `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) 
- Non-blocking I/O using `select`
- Includes automated tests for command processing 🧪

## Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (if running in a container)
- No external dependencies required (uses built-in Python libraries like `socket`, `uuid`, and `select`)

## Assumptions 🤔

- The server runs on a machine with a network connection allowing clients to connect.
- Clients send valid ASCII commands over TCP.
- The server handles a reasonable number of concurrent connections but is not optimized for high-throughput scenarios.
- The environment where this server runs supports Python 3.9+ or Docker.
- Clients properly disconnect when finished using the server.

## Decisions Made 🧠

- **Non-blocking I/O**: The service uses `select` for non-blocking I/O to handle multiple client connections concurrently without blocking the main thread. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in managing moderate concurrency but may not be the best choice for extremely high concurrency.
- **Threading for Client Handling**: Each client connection is handled in a separate thread for simplicity and responsiveness. This model is sufficient for a small number of clients but could be optimized by using a thread pool or asynchronous I/O for larger-scale environments.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The server handles `SIGINT` to shut down gracefully, ensuring resources are released and connections are properly closed. This prevents issues like resource leakage in production environments.
- **UUID for Unique Server ID**: A UUID is used for the server's unique identifier. This decision ensures that each server instance is distinguishable across environments, making it suitable for distributed systems.
- **Command Processing Structure**: Commands are processed by the `process_command` function, which is simple and clear. It ensures separation of concerns, but could be enhanced for more complex command sets.
- **Error Handling**: Unknown commands return a simple error message. This is appropriate for the current scope but could be expanded with more detailed error codes or structured response formats.
- **Test Strategy**: The tests focus on validating the basic functionality of the server's command responses. Additional tests for concurrency and edge cases could further improve the robustness of the solution.
- **Threading vs. Async I/O**: Threading was chosen for simplicity, but future scalability concerns could lead to a switch to `asyncio` or another asynchronous model.
- **TCP Port Binding**: The server binds to `0.0.0.0` on port `9999`, making it easily deployable but not optimized for production scenarios that may require port management or interface restrictions.

## Installation 🛠️

### Running Locally 🖥️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository>
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```sh
   python socket_server.py
   ```

### Running with Docker 🐳

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t socket-server .
   ```
2. Run the container in detached mode:
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 9999:9999 socket-server
   ```

## Usage 💻

Clients can send commands via a TCP connection to the server at port `9999`. Example usage:

```sh
nc localhost 9999
WHO
```

To stop the server, use `Ctrl+C` (if running locally) or `docker stop <container-id>` (if running in Docker).

## Testing 🧪

Run the test script to validate server functionality:

```sh
python tests.py
```

### Test Cases 📝:

- `WHO` command should return the number of connected clients.
- `WHERE` command should return a valid UUID.
- `WHY` command should return "42".
- An unknown command should return an error message.

## Further Improvements 🚀

- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for clients to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the server for handling a larger number of concurrent connections.
- **Logging**: Enhance logging to include timestamps and detailed error information. Implement structured logging with log levels to capture critical events and system metrics.
- **Protocol Enhancement**: While TCP is suitable for short, fast, low-latency communication, it lacks built-in features for security, logging, and structured data handling. Transitioning to a RESTful API could provide better security, integrated logging, and support for structured data formats like JSON.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploying this application on Kubernetes using Helm charts and managing deployments with ArgoCD can streamline operations. This approach offers benefits such as version control, automated rollbacks, and continuous deployment capabilities.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate the project into a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. This ensures consistent and reliable deployments, reduces manual intervention, and accelerates development cycles.
- **Platform Considerations**: Due to its reliance on non-HTTP ports, this application is unlikely to be suitable for Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, which typically support HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Alternative deployment strategies should be considered for environments requiring non-HTTP protocols.

## Observability 👀

- The server can be enhanced with a logging mechanism (e.g., Python's built-in logging module) to track events such as connection status, errors, and received commands.
- Integration with external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) could be useful for tracking server metrics like client count, response times, and error rates.
